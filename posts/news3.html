<p>Big grand-touring coupes are anachronisms, conceived for a time when sophisticated men wore Sansabelt slacks and carefully coordinated their sport coats and turtlenecks. When sideburns mattered, and every adult smoked three packs of Tareytons and drank a six-pack of Michelob every day. A time when Sinatra set the standard. But here—at the tail end of the 21st century’s tattooed, crossover-obsessed, virtue-signaling second eco-decade—comes the 2019 BMW M850i xDrive coupe. It’s a twin-turbocharged, all-wheel-drive 523-hp fondue pot.</p>
<p>“God, it looks like an Accord coupe,” a friend blurted upon seeing the revived 8-series for the first time. That’s a cruel stretch, but BMW certainly didn’t bring back the old 8 with this new one. That previous 8-series, the E31 produced between 1990 and 1999, was brilliantly distinctive with its low cowl, shark nose, tall greenhouse, and pop-up headlights. Even decades later, it remains one of BMW’s cleanest, most glamorously imperious designs, the mere sight of which bursts blood vessels. Current pedestrian-protection regulations and the reality of packaging various electronic doohickeys and whatnots mean reproducing that stiletto profile today is impossible. But while this new G15 series has plenty of busy, provocative styling cues, they don’t quite pull together as harmoniously. Hey, the first 8-series is a tough act to follow. And it didn’t need to spawn convertible and four-door Gran Coupe spinoffs, the trio of which will replace the 6-series in BMW’s lineup. (The number 6 will live on aboard the big-box Gran Turismo near-crossover.) Compensating for any diminution of visual wallop, the new 8-series is a seriously fast automobile. And seriously capable in practically every way, too.</p>

<p>The M850i uses a version of BMW’s twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8. At least initially, the new 8-series will be available only in this form, which exists in that twilight zone between regular-production BMWs and full-blown M models. It splits the difference between the 456-hp V-8 used in the M550i and the 617-hp version in the M5 Competition. Fittingly, this is the same awkward, noncommittal space pioneered 25 years ago by the best of the old 8s, the fortified, 372-hp 12-cylinder 850CSi.</p>
<p>At 523 horsepower, the M850i doesn’t feel like much of a compromise, though. Like almost all modern turbocharged engines, this 4.4-liter V-8 is tuned for low-end torque, and there’s a monstrous 553 lb-ft available at a mere 1800 rpm and sustained until 4600 rpm. And it’s not as if there’s a lack of thump lower or higher in the tachometer. Backing up all that grunt is the ZF eight-speed automatic transmission that has been adopted by nearly every manufacturer except Maytag and Schwinn. BMW has been installing this 'box in its cars and crossovers for a decade now and has massaged it over time into an exceptionally pleasant thing when left to its own devices and a fairly responsive one when it’s manually shifted.</p>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2019-bmw-m850i-xdrive-coupe-118-1551975676.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=980:*" alt=""></p>
<p>At 4400 pounds, the M850i is no lightweight. But with all-wheel drive, this coupe launches with the unyielding determination of a rhino escaping rehab. With the drive mode set to Sport Plus, there’s vibrato from the exhaust, and even before the driver steps on both brake and accelerator, the car seems to rock against its brakes with anticipation. Then you lift your left foot and it’s let loose. The 245/35R-20 front and 275/30R-20 rear Bridgestone Potenza S007s dig into the tarmac as if they were going to plant winter wheat in the resulting furrows, and the 8-series makes the run from zero to 60 mph in just 3.3 seconds, with the quarter-mile flashing past in 11.5 at 123 mph. That’s not supercar performance in 2019, but it was in 1999. And in 2019, it’s still damn quick for a GT.</p>
<p>Not only is the M850i tidier than the Continental GT, but its 191.2-inch length and 111.1-inch wheelbase mean it’s a bit smaller than the 650i it replaces. It is not, however, a small car. In fact, its wheelbase is 5.4 inches longer than that of the last 8-series, and overall it’s longer by three inches. And its claustrophobic modern greenhouse means that, in traffic, it feels every fraction of those inches. Taller drivers need to recline the seatback to avoid staring straight into the windshield header, and we found rearward visibility lacking. The rear seat is more an ironic comment than a place to put actual humans. To use the word “legroom” back there is to slander legs. At least the windshield is huge and steeply raked, like that in a 1993 Camaro. Or a 1990 Pontiac Trans Sport.</p>

<p>In terms of design, though, the M850i’s interior is the best execution of BMW’s current themes. The instrumentation is built around a high-resolution display framed by half-hexag­onal graphic elements. It’s elegantly designed, easy to read, and somewhat customizable. There’s also a head-up display to keep important information front and center. With the ambient lighting tuned to the precise shades of your emotions, and the heated 20-way-adjustable seats set to toast your buns to a golden hue, this is an eminently pleasant driving cocoon.</p>
<p>In Comfort mode, the M850i is soft and virtually silent, a two-door 7-series. But in Sport and Sport Plus, it transforms into a spectacular grand tourer. The steering effort goes up, the suspension stiffens, and the engine growls. All the isolation that has this machine feeling numb in an urban environment drops away as the road opens for romping. The M850i’s rack actually feels connected to the steering wheel, and it reports back what’s going on with something approaching arrogance; it seems BMW’s steering crisis is over. Dive into a corner and the M850i’s tail comes around with a noticeable assist from the rear-wheel steering, while the rear-biased all-wheel-drive system grants the coupe a nearly neutral feel.</p>
<p>Using the transmission’s quick shifts to great advantage and the engine’s jaw-dropping torque to make up for any mistakes, this big coupe hustles with stunning comfort. Indeed, the 8-series is as adept at sustained high-speed travel as anything, be it a mid-engined supercar or another front-engined GT. We tested the M850i on the same day we did the Bentley Continental GT, and it was freakish how closely the two big GTs mirrored each other’s performance. The BMW’s 656-pound weight advantage offset its deficit of 103 horsepower. Both cars hit 60 mph in the same 3.3 seconds, ran the quarter-mile in 11.5 seconds at 123 mph, and pulled 0.98 g on the skidpad. The big differences between the two aren’t comfort or performance but presence and price. A BMW simply can’t bowl over valets the way a Bentley does. At $118,945 as tested, including its $3000 carbon-fiber roof, the BMW is over $150,000 less expensive than the British barge.</p>
<p>The world has changed since the days of cars like the BMW E9 coupes of the 1960s, the first E24 6-series of the 1970s, and, yes, the E31 8-series. But not every person has. The M850i spits in the face of practically every current market trend, and the handful of people who will buy one should enjoy it in the context where it shines. Fondue, after all, is pretty tasty stuff, and sideburns and double-­knit slacks are bound to become fashionable again. They still brew Michelob. And if you’re going to smoke cigarettes, they may as well be Tareytons.</p>
