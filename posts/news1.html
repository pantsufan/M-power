<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bmw-x3-x4-m-101-1550005953.jpg?crop=0.906xw:0.869xh;0.0442xw,0.0919xh&amp;resize=980:*" alt=""></p>
<p>We recently sat down with an automotive consultant in Europe, reflecting on the discrepancy between the wishes of politicians and bureaucrats and those of automotive customers. While the former two groups want customers to go for downsizing, electrification, and altogether responsible choices, the premium customer has three very different wishes. He or she wants (a) an SUV, (b) all-wheel drive, © ultra-high performance, and (d) all of the above. We wondered: Will humankind ever grow up?</p>
<p>Perhaps, but in the meantime, BMW’s M performance division has listened to its customers attentively, and here are the most recent results: the X3 M and its coupelike derivative, the X4 M. At 473 horsepower, they are positioned well above the current range toppers, the 355-hp X3 and X4 M40i. And because too much is not enough, BMW is giving us Competition versions as well. Their engines are rated at 503 horsepower, and they are available right from the beginning.</p>
<p>This awesome power is delivered by the newly christened S58 engine, BMW M’s derivative of the corporate B58 engine. But it’s bored out and comes with a shorter stroke (losing a precious 5 cc of displacement in the process), and the M division has touched simply everything to turn it into a loud and high-revving powerhouse. Both engines produce maximum power at 7300 rpm, and the maximum torque of 442 lb-ft is served up from 2600 to 5500 rpm (5950 for the Competition version).</p>
<p>Force fed by a pair of turbochargers, the S58 is fitted with a forged crankshaft and a DOHC 24-valve head featuring variable intake- and exhaust-valve timing and variable intake-valve lift. It sends its torque through a ZF-supplied eight-speed automatic transmission that shifts so quickly, you won’t miss a dual-clutch box (but perhaps a manual). According to BMW, zero to 60 mph happens in 4.0 seconds for the Competition (add a tenth for the regular X3 M and X4 M), and top speed is governed at 155 mph but can be raised to 174 mph on the regular models and 177 mph on the Competition models. Official EPA fuel-economy estimates are still pending, but BMW M promises very reasonable figures.</p>

<p>But it’s not just up to the engine to equalize the nearly two tons of weight. The other half of the job falls to the chassis and suspension, which have been significantly upgraded from the M40i models. An array of changes to the kinematics partner with special dampers and a special power-steering unit, which makes the true M models stiffer and helps them handle with more precision. The heavily rear-biased all-wheel-drive powertrain leans on the M5’s system. Add to that the electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential, and you have a two-ton SUV that handles like a sports car and loves to hang out its tail.</p>

<p>High-performance brakes are standard, and the models are fitted with staggered tires: 255/45ZR-20 front and 265/45ZR-20 rear rubber is standard. Larger 21-inch wheels are optional. And we would consider going for them, just as we might go for the pretty carbon-fiber appearance package. Because, why not. It’ll help set the X3 M and X4 M even further apart from their more standard siblings. Maybe we are just a stand-in for the typical premium customer, right?</p>
<p>Of course, we’d look at the competition, too. There’s the wild Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio, the razor-sharp and soon to be replaced Porsche Macan Turbo, and the V-8–powered Mercedes-AMG GLC63. But these new BMW M models may be the most perfect combination of virtues. U.S. pricing starts at $70,895 for the X3 M and $74,395 for the X4 M; the Competition models will set you back another $7000. Made in the United States, they will be at dealerships starting in mid-July.</p>
